# Computer Vision 2024 Project [CSYS]
Product Classification & Verification
Product classification and recognition is important task to automate tasks
such as inventory management, pricing. For example, a retailer could use
this technology to automatically identify and classify products in a store,
and then use this information to update inventory levels, calculate
products prices, and provide with information about the products.
Project Objectives:
1. Apply Image preprocessing or Feature Extraction techniques
where needed.
2. Train at least two classification model to determine the product
category. You can use Classical computer vision or deep learning.
3. Train a one/few shot learning model (e.g., Siamese) to verify if a
product exists and recognize its type [Bonus].
Minimum Requirements:
a. You must use at least two classification model (classical or deep
learning) for recognizing the product type.
b. You cannot use pixels directly as features in case of classical
computer vision. You must use a feature extraction method first
(e.g., BoW using SIFT) and then use a classifier like SVM or
logistic regression.
Additional (Not required but bonus)
c. Train a Siamese model for one/few shot learning task.
